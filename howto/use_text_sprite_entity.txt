# Declare a text sprite entity

## Sample

	initial_properties = {
		visual = "text",
		visual_size = {x = 1.0, y = 1.0},
		mesh = "\\\\\\{\\^\\}\n\n{orange}Kidscode\n{#0FF/#00F}Érîthréà\n{#ABCDEF/#456789}Eûphôriâ^0.1;0.2;0.1;0.0;0.0",
		colors = { "#FFFFC0FF", "#80808080", "#40404080" },
	},

## Parameters

- visual_size : X scale, Y scale
- mesh : text, border size, X padding, Y padding, X offset, Y offset
- colors : text color, background color, border color

The text separator is the circumflex.

The value separator is the semicolon.

## Values

- border size : tells the size of the border (in character height unit)
- X/Y padding : tells how much padding is added between the text and the border (in character size unit)
- X/Y offset : tells how much offset is added to the text position inside the frame (in character size unit)

The actual text frame width is computed from the frame height and longest text line width.

The text can contains named or hexadecimal colors between accolades.

Hexadecimal colors start by a hash mark, and can contain 3 or 6 hexadecimal digits.

Both the top and bottom colors can be provided, by separating them with a slash character.

Special characters can be escaped by preceding them with a backslash character.

# Change its text
